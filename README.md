# sql-challenge

## Project Aim
To understand SQL database by importing CSV files data to perform data modelling, data engineering and data analysis. 

## Project Description
This project mainly utilises pgAdmin4 to create tables to hold data import from CSV files into SQL database, and making analyses using the data provided. 
In corporate with Quick DBD to illustrate the relationships of the data objects by identifying primary and foreign keys in each tables. Jupyter notebook is also used to illustrate how these csv data can be imported into database by using Python command alternative to specific SQL. 

### Advantages of SQL
 - Less complex, easy to use
 - Each database can hold multiples files, and each file can hold multiple tables. Great use for to store large data.
 - Can specify different tyes of keys to make connections among tables. 
 -Query perform quick and efficient for large data

### Disadvantages of SQL
 - Unable to perform more complex queries
 - Data retrieval is not easy, need to constantly delete tables and re-run the code

## Project Methods:
